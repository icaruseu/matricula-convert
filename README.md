# Matricula Convert

This is a tool that converts various input formats into parish, book and image data that Matricula can import. Currently it only works on MDB files produced by the internal export from Augias 9.2 and X.

Note:

To parse MS Access files, the package directly incorporates the [AccessDB Parser](https://github.com/claroty/access_parser) library, published under an `Apache 2.0` license.
